# LDAPReindexingScript
This simple script combines the inherited commands to perform the Reindexing activity of a TDS LDAP server.  Each directory server holds a Data base to store the data. And by doing re-indexing, we're going to perform table indexes re-organization &amp; table rows compression, which eventually improves the performance of the data base.
